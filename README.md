# TransformersNLP

This repository contains Colab notebooks and video walkthroughs demonstrating various NLP tasks using Keras NLP and Hugging Face Transformers. Each notebook is accompanied by a recorded debug trace to help you follow along with the implementation.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Colab notebooks for each pattern.  
- `videos/`: Recorded walkthroughs (MP4) with debug traces.  
- `README.md`: This file.
